            Service &amp; Scholar is a project built to help active duty service members earn degrees while still in uniform
            without burning out, losing momentum, or wasting their education benefits.

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            To provide clear, practical guidance that helps service members use their education benefits wisely and finish
            degrees that support their long-term goals in and out of the military.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus is on being realistic and respectful of the military lifestyle. Long shifts, rotating schedules, and
            sudden changes are expected here, not treated as excuses. Service &amp; Scholar aims to make college a structured,
            manageable part of that reality, not something you’re always “meaning to start.”

        <h2>Who’s behind it</h2>
        <p>
          Service &amp; Scholar is run by an active duty service member with over 10 years of continuous service and a
          parallel track of earning college credits and degrees using military education benefits.
        </p>

        <!-- Independence statement woven in -->
        <p>
          This is an independent educational resource built from lived experience. Service &amp; Scholar is not affiliated with,
          endorsed by, or an official representative of the U.S. Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs,
          or any branch of the U.S. military.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over that time, I’ve navigated Tuition Assistance, the GI Bill, CLEP and DSST exams, credit transfers,
          shifting degree plans, and the realities of going to school while working in demanding, dynamic environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve made mistakes, taken the long way around on some decisions, and learned how to build systems that actually
          survive the day-to-day, deployments, and last-minute taskers. Service &amp; Scholar exists so you don’t have to
          learn all of that the hard way.
        </p>

        <!-- Optional: quick “verify with official sources” reminder without getting preachy -->
        <p>
          Policies and eligibility can vary by branch, command, and time—so the goal here is clarity and direction, with the
          expectation that you’ll verify final details with your Education Office/ESO, chain of command, and official resources.
